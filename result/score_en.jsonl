One of the major highlights was the acquisition of Big Pictures, a renowned film production company, in April. This asset acquisition, valued at $100 million, allowed MediaCorp to broaden its business scope and tap into the lucrative film industry. The decision to acquire Big Pictures was preceded by a series of strategic events, including the appointment of a new CEO in January. The new CEO brought in fresh leadership and expertise, setting the stage for major acquisitions and growth. In February, MediaCorp conducted a strategic market analysis, which identified Big Pictures as a strategic acquisition target with significant growth prospects. This analysis paved the way for the due diligence process initiated in March, ensuring a thorough assessment of the target company's value and mitigating risks associated with the acquisition.\nThe impact of the Big Pictures acquisition was reflected in MediaCorp's financial indicators. The operating income for the year reached $800 million, indicating the success of the company's main business and other income streams. This increase in operating income can be attributed to the expansion of MediaCorp's business scope through the acquisition. Additionally, the net profit for the year stood at $150 million, showcasing the company's ability to effectively control costs and generate substantial returns. The acquisition of Big Pictures also had a positive impact on MediaCorp's total assets, which reached $2 billion by the end of the year. This increase in assets can be attributed to the inclusion of Big Pictures' assets in MediaCorp's portfolio.\nIn May, MediaCorp made a major investment of $50 million in Project Vision, a cutting-edge virtual reality technology startup. This investment further diversified MediaCorp's business areas and contributed to enhanced profitability. Additionally, in June, MediaCorp completed the acquisition of 30% equity of Digital Media Solutions, further expanding its market share and enhancing the company's control."]}, "ROUGELScore": 0.4999999950000001, "Words_Precision": 0.057803468208092484, "Words_Recall": 0.7692307692307693, "Sentences_Precision": 0.0, "Sentences_Recall": 0.0, "completeness": 0.0, "hallucination": 1.0, "irrelevance": 0.0, "responses": "{\n    \"complete_ids\": [],\n    \"irrelevant_ids\": [],\n    \"hallucinate_ids\": [\n        1\n    ]\n}"}
